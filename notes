This error indicates your application is trying to make a fetch request to localhost:3000 in production, which won't work since your production app isn't running locally. Here's how to fix it:

Root Cause
The error shows:

fetch failed... ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:3000
This means somewhere in your /dashboard page, you're making API requests to http://localhost:3000 instead of using relative paths or environment variables.

Solution
Fix API Request URLs:
In your dashboard page or components, replace hardcoded localhost URLs with:

typescript
// Before
const res = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/emails')

// After (use relative path)
const res = await fetch('/api/emails')

// Or better, use environment variable
const res = await fetch(`${process.env.NEXTAUTH_URL}/api/emails`)
